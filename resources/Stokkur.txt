At Stokkur my main responsibility was native android development. As it turned out however, we
were short on backend developers and since I had some experience in that department I
volunteered to work on the backend for the CCP companion app. It was my first exposure to a
service that had users in the tens of thousands at any given moment. Also queues and
microservices were new for me. An awesome learning experience and we took great pride in
the backend which ended up very efficient and stable. 

Another project there which led was creating a self service kiosk app for a chain of car washes. 
Stokkur had a rigid QA process which required scoping and organizing such a big project from 
scratch, analysing potential bottlenecks and complications to be able to anticipate. The project 
went well. I should however wash my car more frequently. 

I worked closely with Raquelita which has in the meantime been promoted to CEO and the CTO HalldÃ³r 
which was then lead backend programmer. I would have stayed on at Stokkur for longer than I did, 
but as fate would have it we parted ways.
