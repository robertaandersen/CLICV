I initially got this job as a part of a summer job program for university students. My 
responsibilities were writing an internal web for their staff with a message board, news 
sections, announcements, photo albums etc. It was requested that I did so in Drupal. They 
also release a monthly newsletter electronically which was also a part of my day to day. 
So a lot of sysadmin stuff, setting up LAMP servers, rebooting machines, making sure disks 
didnâ€™t run out of space etc. Also a part of the job was first level IT support for their 
staff.  

I had severe impostor syndrome as this was my first job and I was just a student, but the 
people there were lovely and offered me to stay on part time with them after my tenure ran 
its course which I did.
