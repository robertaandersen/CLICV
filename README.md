# CLICV
Command line interface Resume

This is a CLI version of my CV. It's not super serious and was more though of as a fun project plus I need to practise my python 'skills'

The idea is kindow a ripof from a friend of mine [JÃ³i aka 7oi]('https://github.com/7oi'). 

To run this as a docker ```docker run -it robertreynisson/clicv``` should do the trick.
